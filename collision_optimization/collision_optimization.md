# Brute Force

check collision all of pairs

cell_collision_bruteforce.py

# Sweep and Prune

sort by one axis and check only intersect object

cell_collision_sweep_and_prune.py

# Uniform Grid Space Partitioning

partitioning space and check only inside one space

cell_collision_UGSP.py

# Uniform Grid Space Partitioning with Hashing

UGSP with hashing

no memory waste by empty space

# KD tree

partitioning space efficiently with KD tree

object can overlaps many of space

## KD tree iteratively

partitioning space efficiently with KD tree

python recursive function is extremly slow.

# Todo (may not be)

## Bouding Volumn Hierarchy

partitioning object efficiently

objects don't overlap
